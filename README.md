## Features
* Learn how to create CIM symbols in the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript
* Modify the properties of symbol layers 
* Modify your own custom symbols by importing the symbol JSON
* When you are done creating your symbol, copy the JSON and use it in your own ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript application!

## Instructions

Get started by clicking the `Add symbol layer` button to add a symbol layer to your CIMSymbol. You can then choose from a predefined list of icons and shapes, or import your own symbol layer JSON. After selecting your first symbol layer, you can change its properties (size, anchor point, rotation, etc.) by clicking on the symbol layer type in the right panel. Use the expand arrow to the right of the symbol layer to discover more properties to customize.

You can add as many symbol layers as you like, and can reorder them by clicking on the symbol layer and dragging it to the desired location in the list.

When you are ready to see what the symbol looks like on the layer in the map, click `Apply to feature layer`. If you are satisfied with how your symbol looks, click `Get SymbolJSON` to convert your symbol to JSON. You can use this JSON to bring the symbol you created into your application on the `CIMSymbol.data.symbol` property.

## Requirements

* Web browser with access to the Internet

## Resources

The [CIMSymbol](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-symbols-CIMSymbol.html) API reference page provides some example symbols and more information about the properties of a symbol. The [CIM specification](https://github.com/Esri/cim-spec) provides more detailed information on specific properties for each symbol layer type.

To see the CIM symbols in action, check out the following sample applications:
